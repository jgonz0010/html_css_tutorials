    <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element.</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
    </ul>
